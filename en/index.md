RDMO project continues
====

The Research Data Management Organiser (RDMO) enables institutions as well as researchers
to plan and carry out their management of research data. RDMO can assemble all relevant planning information 
and data management tasks across the whole life cycle of the research data. 

RDMO is ready for application in smaller or bigger projects. In the next projectphase, starting October 2017, the 
RDMO tool will be extended and the project partners AIP, FHP, and KIT Library will collaborate with the RDMO users
to improve the its usage. 
The tool will be extended by enhancing its implementation of roles and interfaces to institutional infrastructure, 
e.g. repositories, ticketing systems, and AAI. 
Tutorials, documentation and other material are planned for dissemination, and workshops for users and developers.
