Workpackages
============

Extension of RDMO software
-------

The RDMO today has all the basic features for organising the data management. Planned extensions and 
changes will simplify the application by more flexible information gathering routines and the definition of
tasks by users.


Integration into exisiting infrastructure
--------

Improving the standardised installation and maintenance procedures. Support for widely used 
authentication and authorisation mechanisms (LDAP, Sibboleth, OAuth, ORCID) for already deployed systems in academia,
e.g. bwIDM (identity management of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg). With the BMBF-Initiatve many Universities habe created counselling for 
research data management, and RDMO is a useful tool for their work. And we strive to get RDMO established as a tool
in institutional workflows for project applications.

Sustainability and community building
----------

RDMO has been created as a tool for research data management. One of the main tasks of the project is to collaborate with all 
parties enganged in the realm of research data managent, participating in all efforts to further its 
development. This includes collaboration within and beyond RDA, e.g. with DCC and CDL.


Dissemination and Training
------------------------------

Preparation and publication of suitable material and concepts for tutorials and workshops for various use cases, e.g. data management plan creation for a 
scientist, views for the  IT department on storage requirements, or extraction of costs for a group head.
