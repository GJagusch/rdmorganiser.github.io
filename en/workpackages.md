Workpackages
============

Concept
-------

The content and its logical structure and dependencies have to be cast into a user friendly flow of questions, which is the main task of WP1. It uses material already available from previous work which will be critically assessed, extended and modularised. In addition, we want to include specialized sections for disciplinary variations.

The first iteration will chiefly assess the available Know-How from our own work and already published works. The general questions and the specialised sections for specific target groups need to be carefully fitted to create a robust application with a decision tree that enables a stable implementation. In following iterations the usability, robustness and extensibility will be reviewed and improved.

Software
--------

This workpackage will implement the concepts worked out in "Concepts". This requires the selection of an appropriate software platform and the development of an architecture and a database model. We base this on our experiences with implementing web applications and will make use of the Open Source code of [DMPonline](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk) and [DMPTool](https://dmptool.org/).

The core of the architecture and basic features (i.e. interaction with user, server/client functionalities, multi-lingual questions) of the planned application are developed in parallel with conceptual work. Also, we will explore how to interface with other tools and existing infrastructure. A prototype based on this work, with a preliminary set of questions, has formed the basis for a first round of testing with collaborating projects.

In later stages, functionalities like export/import and continuous updating of the gathered information, templates for output formats etc. will be added. The final version of the tool is planned to be applicable within small project groups as well as for whole institutions running independent instances of the software.

The source code will be available from the first stages of development on with an OpenSource license (Apache 2.0) on [github.com/rdmorganiser](https://github.com/rdmorganiser).

Testing by Community and Users
------------------------------

Feedback and input from the community are needed with regards to assess the usability, to work out extended sets of discipline-specific questions or to gather feedback on the various features. Improving the tool is an iterative process that will help to eliminate errors and problems of the implementation.

WP3 will organize tests with collaborating projects and partners (from Social Sciences and Astronomy, from data providers and IT departments) and also workshops for a broader audience to gather input for the iterative improvement of the tool. We plan two rounds of tests and workshops, the first round is already done, the second will be done a year after the project has started. Especially the first round is designed to gather input for community specific aspects of the questionnaire and associated data management tasks.

While the feedback from scientists will focus on gathering specifics on content, discussion with IT infrastructure providers will address deployment into and adaptability of features to the institutional context. This input and interaction is a necessary element for delivering a useful tool that can be efficiently implemented and maintained.

The final version of the tool will be presented and discussed in a public workshop. In some cases, our collaborators will offer deployment of the RDMO for various departments or groups.
