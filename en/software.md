Software
========

RDMO will be implemented as a web application. It will be, even in the development stage, available as open-source software on [github.com](https://github.com/rdmorganiser). Our main use case is the collaborative editing and maintenance of all necessary information for a sustainable data management. This will be done along *projects*, which will be defined by the users in their particular context.

As of now, we plan the following features:

Input
-----

The input of all information about a project will be done via a structures interview using an interactive web interface. This includes the following functions:

* Collaborative work of the different Stakeholders
* Skipping of redundant questions based on the given answers
* Display of progress of the given input
* Different widgets (rulers, check boxes, drop-down lists)
* Use of a controlled vocabulary for answer choices
* Discussion and comments
* Upload of documents (e.g. meta data documentation, codebooks, etc.)
* Freezing of all information at a point in time using snapshots

Output
------

The information can be retrieved in several ways:

* Aggregation of the given information to textual views (e.g. data management plans to be used in the application process of Horizon 2020)
* Time line of all tasks to be done regarding data management
* Notifications about upcoming events
* Overview summarizing different projects, e.g. information about required IT-resources
* Interfaces to external services or data models (e.g. CERIF)

Setup and operation
-------------------

We put a special focus on making RDMO easily installable and customisable, so that institutions like research institutes, libraries and university groups can use it for their work. This includes:

* Complete customisation of the user interface
    * Corporate design
    * Layout
* Complete customisation of the content
    * Questions and answering options
    * Help text incl. links to external sources
    * Templates for textual data management plans
    * Tasks to be done
* Integration into the local infrastructure
    * Authorisation and authentication
    * APIs
