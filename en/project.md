Project
=======

**Research Data Management Organiser (RDMO) supports the systematic planning, organisation and implementation of research data management throughout the course of a project. An additional feature is the output of a data management plan in the form of a text documents, according to funder requirements.**

Data management plans are one of the crucial components of research data management, but their potential is rarely exhausted. Often they are only a part of the project proposal, never again updated. RDMO is a companion during the whole research process offering multiple functionalities to track the data. 
Among the core functionalities of RDMO are:
  * central instance for all informations pertaining to the reserach data managment of a project
  * adaptable templates for questionnaire and reporting 
  * easy customisation of look and feel, versioning of information
  * built in multilingual support
  * templates for various purposes, e.g. funder required DMP 

The project now targets:
  * extending the data model towards task definition and handling
  * role based views for stakeholders across multiple projects
  * support of repositories and identifier systems to link with data storage systems or long term archives
  * support for suggestion of suitable data repositores, and possibly cost estimations based on their terms
  * extension of interfaces to authentication and authorisation systems
  * participation in the effort of creating an international exchange format for DMP
  * improvement of technical installation, maitenance and update procedures 

The RDMO collaborates with multiple institutions, discipline specific and other scientific organisations, and also international 
initiatives to ensure the usefulness and sustainability of the software and its applications. For questions and contact, pleasae send a mail to [rdmo-team@listserv.dfn.de] . 

The RDMO project is funded by DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft).


is to ensure that research data produced in a project are (re-)usable and accessible - during the project as well as afterwards. It comprises a number of strategies and methods associated with various aspects of the research and research data lifecycle as well as some related topics. A data management plan (DMP) is a means to outline and document these items. Recently, several institutions have developed online tools to support researchers in writing such a data management plan. Pioneers were the UK-based [Digital Curation Centre (DCC)](http://www.dcc.ac.uk) in UK with [DMPonline](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk), the [California Digital Library (CDL)](http://www.cdlib.org) with [DMPTool](https://dmptool.org/), and in Germany the [Universit√§t Bielefeld](https://data.uni-bielefeld.de/de/data-management-plan).

DMPs have a great potential - they can be used to optimise the data management from the beginning and to serve as a roadmap that gives guidance for the various data management tasks during the lifetime of a project. DMPs support an appropriate and effective data management which ensures that the produced research data are re-usable within and outside the project and can be transferred to long-term preservation without unnecessary obstacles. It also enhances the effectiveness and quality of the research itself and therefore can generate a considerable benefit for researchers.

However, the tools mentioned above focus on the requirements of funding agencies and the creation of DMPs as part of a research proposal. While they are useful in that respect, they do not sufficiently support the other functionalities mentioned above.

The RDMO project aims to fill this gap. Based on preliminary work, in particular from the WissGrid project (see [WissGrid-Leitfaden zum Forschungsdatenmanagement]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/Leitfaden_Data-Management-WissGrid.pdf)), it develops an online tool that takes an integrated approach and will support the systematic planning, organisation and implementation of research data management throughout the whole project and the research data lifecycle, including the output of a DMP document.

The target group comprises all parties involved in research data management, i.e. researchers, PIs, institutional data managers, IT departments etc. Adaptations to discipline-specific or institutional needs are supported. The installation of the tool into local environments and its integration into existing administrative IT infrastructure and workflows is given special consideration. The tool will be multilingual (at first German and English).
