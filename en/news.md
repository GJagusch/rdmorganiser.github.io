March 2018
----------

This month we attended the [Open Science Conference](https://www.open-science-conference.eu/) and the 11th [RDA Plenary Meeting](https://www.rd-alliance.org/plenaries/rda-eleventh-plenary-meeting-berlin-germany) and had many stimulating discussions. One big topic are machine actionable DMPs (*maDMPs*). In RDMO we support the workflow during a whole project and the integration in the infrastructure right from the start and hence, we are pioneers.
Our main goals are at the moment the *software architecture* for which we need a common standard, templates for *terms of use* and *data protection* and moreover, we provide a *postcard*, a *poster* and *presentation slides* for you to use freely.

February 2018
-------------

On 8th and 9th of February, the current and new members of the RDMO project team came together for the **kickoff-meeting of the second phase of the RDMO project** at the Leibniz-Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam (AIP).

After a short introduction, we got down to business and assmbled our **work plan** for the next 6 months:

* RDMO will be present in future **workshops and conferences**. The next meetings are the [Open Science Conference](https://www.open-science-conference.eu/) and the [RDA Plenary Meeting](https://www.rd-alliance.org/plenaries/rda-eleventh-plenary-meeting-berlin-germany) in March. Both meetings are in Berlin.
* We identified **upcoming features** in RDMO and prioritised their implementation. We plan to add the much wanted improved Import/Export in the next month. Next, we will improve the management interface, including the possibility to copy and move catalogs, sections, etc. Following up, we will implement the interface to 3rd party tools via plugins and the integration of external APIs, e.g. re3data.org.
* We will further work on **tutorials and material for training and outreach**.
* Most institutions who plan to use RDMO will need to create a **documentation regarding data privacy regulations** and **terms of use** (including probably a consent declaration of users for DPR) in the process. We plan to support this by providing corresponding templates on our webpage.

January 2018
------------

We welcome our **new team members** Kerstin Vanessa Wedlich (KIT) and Olaf Michaelis (AIP). While Kerstin will work on the integration of RDMO into forschungsdaten.info, Olaf will delevelop the RDMO codebase further and help the technical support.

We published our first two **tutorials** on ["How do I create a catalogue in RDMO?"](https://forschungsdaten.org/index.php/Katalog_erstellen) and ["How do I create a view in RDMO?"](https://forschungsdaten.org/index.php/ansicht_erstellen) (in German). A page for [Frequently Asked Questions](http://www.forschungsdaten.org/index.php/FAQs) was created as well.

A **new questionaire** for the Switzer National Fonds (SNF) was created and can be obtained on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo-catalog).
