On this page, we briefly summarize our activities. For up-to-date information please subscribe to your [mailing list](https://www.listserv.dfn.de/sympa/info/rdmo) or follow us on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/rdmorganiser).

Januar 2019
-----------

We release **Version 0.12.0** of RDMO with improved error handling, a button for the URI prefix and the possibility to delete user profiles. Two new **[Screencasts](https://rdmorganiser.github.io/materialien/)** have been released. We collect now *question catalogs and views*. *Janine Straka* from the RMDO team will be on maternity leave from February and then on parental leave. From March on, *Ulrike Wuttke* will take over the substitution.

Dezember 2018
-------------

It is now clear that *Jochen Klar* will leave the AIP, but will continue to work closely with the RDMO team in the future. More screencasts are in preparation.

November 2018
-------------

We release **version 0.11.0** of RDMO with the *new data model*. With the new structure it will be possible to easily create your own question catalogs and at the same time to use the domain model of the whole RDMO community to reuse views, question catalogs, etc. We have also revised our documentation and added the new work steps.

In addition, we have **removed the subsections** of the question catalog and redesigned the question sets so that they now always correspond to a page in the interview, have their own title and appear in the small overview on the page. We were a guest at the **[Open Science Forum in Luxembourg](https://openscience2018.uni.lu/)** and gave a lecture on data management in the Digital Humanities. RDMO was also used in a hands-on session. The materials are published on Zenodo. We also published a first **[screencast](https://rdmorganiser.github.io/en/promotion/)** on our website. More screencasts will follow soon.


October 2018
------------

On the 24th October we presented a RDMO poster at the **[International Open Access Week 2018](http://www.open-access-berlin.de/aktivitaeten/oa-week-2018)** in Berlin. Moreover we improved our **Postcard** and there is now a English [version](https://rdmorganiser.github.io/en/promotion/).

September 2018
--------------

At the beginning of September the first bigger Community-Meeting took place at the University of Duisburg-Essen with a lot of discussions. Here is a German report of the meeting: http://www.forschungsdaten.org/index.php/Erstes_Community-Treffen 
Mid-September we were at the Library of Dresden, where RDMO is quite new. At the end of September we had our second meeting of the project members in Karlsruhe and agreed on the following plan of main features:

2018:

* Finalisation of Import/Export
* Extension of API and RDMO connection to other examplary software 
* Release of new data model

2019:
* Implementation of role-based views across projects 
* Further development of collaborative features of RDMO for comments and versioning of input
* Diffâ€“function for snapshots
* Genuine multilingualism 
* Client capability

August 2018
-----------

In August weprepaired the first and big **Community Meeting** of RDMO which will take place at the University Duisburg-Essen. We have created a **[set of topical slides](https://rdmorganiser.github.io/en/promotion/)** which was asked for and which you are allowed to re-use and adapt. Moreover, the next meeting of the project members will be in September.

July 2018
---------

In July we decided, based on discussions with the community, to evolve a restricted **multi-clientcapability** in RDMO, but expected not before next year. We were working very hard on the refractoring of our **data model** and we will report about it soon.
Moreover, there are now two **[movies](https://rdmorganiser.github.io/en/promotion/)** about what RDMO, which you can re-use.

June 2018
----------

In June we added submenues to our website to achieve a clear arrangement, for example we added the topic **Data protection({{site.baseurl}}/en/protection)**. There is now a **Quick tutorial** for the import and export available: http://www.forschungsdaten.org/index.php/Import_Export . At the 13th of June we gave a *[talk]({{ site.baseurl}}/en/talks)* about RDMO at the 107th Bibliothekartag.

April & May 2018
------------------

In April we were focused on improving the **import and export** and we released a new RDMO version at the beginning of May. Including some mino bug fixes the current **version number is 0.10.2**. Moreover we provide a **[flyer]({{site.baseurl}}/en/promotion)** which you can reuse and adapt for your institute to advertise for your RDMO instance.
The current issue about data security let us introduce a splash screen for the terms of use available since **version 0.10.3**. 

March 2018
------------

This month we attended the [Open Science Conference](https://www.open-science-conference.eu/) and the 11th [RDA Plenary Meeting](https://www.rd-alliance.org/plenaries/rda-eleventh-plenary-meeting-berlin-germany) and had many stimulating discussions. One big topic are machine actionable DMPs (**maDMPs**). In RDMO we support the workflow during a whole project and the integration in the infrastructure right from the start and hence, we are pioneers.
Our main goals are at the moment the *software architecture* for which we need a common standard, templates for *terms of use* and *data protection* and moreover, we provide a [**postcard**, a **poster** and **presentation slides**]({{site.baseurl}}/en/promotion) for you to use freely.

February 2018
----------------

On 8th and 9th of February, the current and new members of the RDMO project team came together for the **kickoff-meeting of the second phase of the RDMO project** at the Leibniz-Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam (AIP).

After a short introduction, we got down to business and assmbled our **work plan** for the next 6 months:

* RDMO will be present in future **workshops and conferences**. The next meetings are the [Open Science Conference](https://www.open-science-conference.eu/) and the [RDA Plenary Meeting](https://www.rd-alliance.org/plenaries/rda-eleventh-plenary-meeting-berlin-germany) in March. Both meetings are in Berlin.
* We identified **upcoming features** in RDMO and prioritised their implementation. We plan to add the much wanted improved Import/Export in the next month. Next, we will improve the management interface, including the possibility to copy and move catalogs, sections, etc. Following up, we will implement the interface to 3rd party tools via plugins and the integration of external APIs, e.g. re3data.org.
* We will further work on **tutorials and material for training and outreach**.
* Most institutions who plan to use RDMO will need to create a **documentation regarding data privacy regulations** and **terms of use** (including probably a consent declaration of users for DPR) in the process. We plan to support this by providing corresponding templates on our webpage.

January 2018
-----------------

We welcome our **new team members** Kerstin Vanessa Wedlich (KIT) and Olaf Michaelis (AIP). While Kerstin will work on the integration of RDMO into forschungsdaten.info, Olaf will delevelop the RDMO codebase further and help the technical support.

We published our first two **tutorials** on ["How do I create a catalogue in RDMO?"](https://forschungsdaten.org/index.php/Katalog_erstellen) and ["How do I create a view in RDMO?"](https://forschungsdaten.org/index.php/ansicht_erstellen) (in German). A page for [Frequently Asked Questions](http://www.forschungsdaten.org/index.php/FAQs) was created as well.

A **new questionaire** for the Switzer National Fonds (SNF) was created and can be obtained on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/rdmorganiser/rdmo-catalog).
